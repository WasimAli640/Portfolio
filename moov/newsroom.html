				<h1>MOOV LAUNCHES WITH STREETSCOOTER TAKEOVER</h1>
				<h2>Seasoned automotive leadership to take on last-mile delivery business</h2>
				<p>WORLDWIDE, November 4, 2021 - MOOV, a global nomad organization overhauling the world of next-day delivery, today announced a deal with Deutsche Post DHL Group (DPDHL) to acquire StreetScooter, the company’s manufacturer of electric light commercial vehicles (eLCVs). The acquisition, which legally closed today, gives MOOV the rights to StreetScooter’s  existing IP, production lines, and subsidiaries in both Switzerland and Japan. With the completion of the deal, MOOV becomes the largest producer of eLCVs in Germany and secures the future of StreetScooter’s ongoing vehicle engineering, battery development and manufacturing capabilities. Concurrently to the acquisition, MOOV has also secured an additional minimum order of 3,000 StreetScooter vehicles from DPDHL to continue electrifying their postal delivery fleet. The acquisition marks MOOV’s first public confirmation out of several large multinational transactions expected to be announced over the coming year.</p>

				<img src="images/dummy-news-img.png" alt="">
				<p>StreetScooter, based in Aachen, Germany, is a leader in the manufacture of eLCVs, currently producing around 3,500 vehicles per annum. Founded in 2010 as part of a private research project and acquired by DPDHL in 2014, the company has deployed a fleet of more than 13,500 of its WORK and WORK L vehicles in Germany alone, along with smaller fleets elsewhere in Europe and in Asia totaling another 3,000 vehicles. StreetScooter operates multiple manufacturing plants in Germany and Switzerland, as well as a distribution team in Japan, employing around 350 individuals in total servicing a production capacity of up to 10,000 vehicles per year. </p>

				<p>“This acquisition provides MOOV with an unparalleled foundation for growth and a head start that is singularly unique in the last-mile electric delivery vehicle market,” said MOOV Chairman Stefan Krause. “With StreetScooter, we have the proven zero-emissions vehicle technology and the supply scale to match the growing worldwide demand for the mass electrification of last mile deliveries–starting from today.”</p>
				<p>“DPDHL is extremely proud of all that the StreetScooter brand has been able to accomplish in such a short time and could not be more confident in handing over the keys to MOOV’s proven and experienced group to accelerate its growth”, said XYZ at DPDHL. “In the logistics business we are constantly reminded that commercial vehicles are the single most important component of creating a greener and more profitable future in mobility, and we look forward to all that the two brands will achieve together.”</p>
				<p>MOOV is headed up by Krause, founder and original CEO of American electric vehicle maker Canoo, who previously held roles as CFO/Board Member of automaker BMW and CFO at Deutsche Bank. The company’s c-suite also boasts Bruno Lambert as President and COO, who was the former chief at EV makers Borgward and Iconiq and President of manufacturing giant Magna Steyr’s Asia division, as well as Dr. Angelika Berger-Sodian, most recently Managing Director of UK operations for Chinese automaker NIO and bestselling author of In the Year of the Tiger, who will serve as CEO. The company has yet to formally disclose its investment partners, but does confirm that they have provided a nine-figure endowment for the company’s immediate development.</p>
				<p>Together, MOOV’s leadership and its investment partners will focus on growing StreetScooter’s untapped potential in international markets, including countries in Europe, North America and Asia. MOOV also anticipates making public several large mobility acquisitions developed in tandem to the StreetScooter deal starting in 2022, which are expected to greatly expand the company’s reach and product line for last-mile delivery and beyond.</p>
